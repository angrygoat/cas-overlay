# CAS Server Overlay - RENCI

Generates a WAR file for deployment of a CAS server for RENCI AD

## Configuration Files

The configuration files in this repository are found under `src/main/webapp`.

## Custom Source Files

Custom source files can be found in `src/main/java`. `LdapMutirecordPersonAttributeDao` is a custom user attribute
data access object that can associate values from multiple LDAP objects with a single user. This class is used to
retrieve the list of groups to which a user belongs. The rest of the custom source files were copied from the CAS
source code and tweaked to suit our needs.

## Configuration and Source Updates

Configuration files can be updated directly in this repository. After adding a new source or configuration file,
examine the stock CAS deployment to see if a file with the same name and path exists. If so, it is necessary to
update the `pom.xml` file to add an exclusion to the WAR overlay configuration.

## Building

To build a new WAR file, run `mvn package`, in the top-level directory of the repository. The WAR file will be built
and placed in `target/cas.war`. This WAR file will contain all of the customizations present in this repository.
